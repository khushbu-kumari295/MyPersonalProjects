                <p>Seattle, Washington, is the largest city in the Pacific Northwest.
                    Located between Puget Sound and Lake Washington in King County, of which it is the county seat, and
                    overlooking Elliott Bay, Seattle is nicknamed The Emerald City.
                    The city is a damp green gem, with an abundance of evergreen trees throughout, and spectacular views
                    of the Cascade mountains to the east and the Olympic mountains to the west.
                    The cultural and business center of the Pacific Northwest, the city and its surrounding areas are
                    the home of the Space Needle, Boeing's aircraft assembly plants, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Costco,
                    Nintendo of America, Starbucks, T-Mobile, and the University of Washington, as well as a vibrant
                    arts and music scene and an excellent park system.</p>
                <p>It may surprise some how pleasant Seattle's weather can be during the summer months. However,
                    Seattle
                    is also well known for its rainy days and hazy skies, and for good reason.
                    The city has a large amount of rainy days per year, but it is usually a light rain or drizzle. Never
                    the less, the metropolitan area will receive many rainy days per year.
                </p>
                <p> The long eight month stretch from November through June brings the worst of the unpleasant weather:
                    The months of November, May, and June will see temperatures ranging from cool in November to
                    somewhat mild in May and June, and all three months with heavy and gray cloud cover, and rain
                    practically everyday. The months of December, January, February, March, and April will see the same
                    heavy and gray cloud cover, rain practically everyday, in addition to cooler and colder
                    temperatures, and some snowfall.
                    The city is ill-equipped to deal with snowfall, so schools may not open when there is heavy
                    snowfall. </p>
