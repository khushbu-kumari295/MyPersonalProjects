                        Seattle Center is an arts, educational, tourism and entertainment center in Seattle,
                        Washington,
                        United
                        States.
                    <p>Connect to the extraordinary at Seattle Center, an active civic, arts and family gathering
                        place
                        in the
                        core
                        of our region. More than 30 cultural, educational, sports and entertainment organizations
                        that
                        reside on
                        the
                        grounds, together with a broad range of public and community programs, create thousands of
                        events on the
                        74-acre campus and attract over 12 million visitors each year. At Seattle Center, part of
                        Uptown
                        Arts &
                        Cultural District, our purpose is to create exceptional events, experiences and environments
                        that
                        delight
                        and inspire the human spirit to build stronger communities. Activities at the Center
                        generate
                        $1.864
                        billion
                        in area business activity, 18,621 jobs and $631 million in labor income (2016 Economic
                        Impact
                        Study).

                        Seattle Center is operated by a city department that is also called Seattle Center. This
                        department
                        plays
                        multiple roles as a business partner, financier, landlord, custodian, event producer and
                        promoter. When
                        the
                        place, the programs and the operations are working together, a magic happens, a
                        transformation
                        occurs.
                        We
                        find that we are drawn to the Center as individuals with diverse interests, and we leave as
                        a
                        community,
                        unified by our respect and appreciation for the human spirit.</p>
